#  Capstone Project - Convention website for Develolper Festival Rostov-On-Don, Russia
I built this project with inspiration from an original webpage [here](https://devfest.gdgrnd.ru/)  using the layout and deisgn style concepts [behance.com](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015). 
GDG RND is an actual community, and the event was an actual event I attended. I am using the content on their website for the Developer Festival of 2019 to implement [this design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015).
The idea is to create an original Conference website based on the design at [behance.com](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015)
